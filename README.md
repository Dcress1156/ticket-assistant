# ticket-assistant

A small application built to assist in customer support/service or roles where ticket tracking is important.

The Email Hinter will take an email and obscure the middle-part of the email. This can be useful if you need to provide an email in a secure way.

The Ticket Tracker will take in ticket numbers (Formatted as #12345) and save them to a list. From there you can copy them to your clipboard.

Other

Written in Rust and powered by egui and eframe. Will continue to update and add features to make it more versatile and streamlined. 
If you encounter any issues with the program please let me know. Feel free to edit and re-distribute this project all you want.

Please note this is just a "quick" version of the app that I built in less than two days for the sole purpose of just using it myself.
